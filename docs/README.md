# Creating a new commercial AWS subaccount

1. Retrieve IAM credentials for commercial organization payer
    commercial account and set them up in your `~/.aws/credentials`
    and/or `~/.aws/config`

2. Retrieve the SAML Document from your Identity Provider (IDP)

    **References:**
    - [G Suite - How to setup custom SAML application](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519?hl=en)
    - [AzureAD SSO with AWS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/amazon-web-service-tutorial)

3. Clone <https://github.com/Over-haul/cloud-accounts-tools> and setup [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

   ``` bash
   git clone git@github.com:Over-haul/cloud-accounts-tools.git
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Over-haul/cloud-accounts-tools.git
   ```

4. Create a new sub account

   ``` bash
   AWS_PROFILE=regular-aws poetry run python setup_account.py -a <accountname> -e infeng+<accountname>@example.com \
       -f </path/to/saml/document.xml> -s <SAML_PROVIDER, defaults to gsuite> -t <--tag-prefix, defaults to thunder> \
       [-l {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}]
   ```

   **Example Output:**

   ``` bash
   $ AWS_PROFILE=master-account pipenv run python setup_account.py \
       -a thunder-aws-app-dev -e infeng+thunder-aws-app-dev@example.com \
       -s gsuite -t thunder -f ./gsuite_metadata.xml

5. Add the commercial SSO role to users

   a) G Suite Instructions
     1. Open G Suite Admin
     2. Users -> select user to edit -> User Information -> **AWS SSO**
     3. Add `arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:role/SSOAdministratorAccess,arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:saml-provider/<TAG_PREFIX>-<SAML_PROVIDER>` or `arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:role/SSOViewOnlyAccess,arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:saml-provider/<TAG_PREFIX>-<SAML_PROVIDER>` (accordingly)
     4. Ensure duration is set to **28800**
     5. Rinse and repeat for all users that require access to new account

   b) AzureAD Instructions
     1. Open `App Role | Preview` for `Amazon Web Services (AWS)`, the trick is to update the following URL with the Application ID and open it in a browser tab `https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationMenuBlade/AppRoles/appId/<Insert Application ID here>/isMSAApp/`
     2. Click `Create App Role` -> Enter `Display Name` e.g. `<SysEnv name> <Role Name>` -> Select `Users/Groups` for `Allowed member types` -> Enter `arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:role/SSOAdministratorAccess,arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:saml-provider/<TAG_PREFIX>-<SAML_PROVIDER>` for `Value` -> Enter whatever you deem appropriate for `Description`
     3. Repeat step 2 but enter `arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:role/SSOViewOnlyAccess,arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:saml-provider/<TAG_PREFIX>-<SAML_PROVIDER>` for `Value`
     4. Go back to list your [Enterprise Applications](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps) -> Click `Amazon Web Services (AWS)` -> Click `Users and groups` -> Click `Add User` -> Click `Users` -> Search and select all users you want to have Administrator access -> Click `Select` at the bottom right side of the screen -> Click `Select Role` and click the `Display Name` you gave to the Administrator role
     5. Repeat step 4 but now select the `Users` you want to have View Only access

6. if you use [saml2aws](https://github.com/Versent/saml2aws), configure local SAML credentials for new commercial account. Add the following to your **`~/.saml2aws`** configuration file:

   a) G Suite

      ``` text
      [<new account name>]
      app_id               =
      url                  = <URL from G Suite's SAML>
      username             = <you>@example.com
      provider             = GoogleApps
      mfa                  = Auto
      skip_verify          = false
      timeout              = 0
      aws_urn              = urn:amazon:webservices
      aws_session_duration = 28800
      aws_profile          = <new account name>
      resource_id          =
      subdomain            =
      role_arn             = arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:role/SSOAdministratorAccess
      region               = us-west-2
      ```

      The SPid above is specific to the commercial/gov providers in the G Suite console.

   b) Azure AD

      ``` text
      [<new account name>]
      app_id               = <Application ID for Amazon Web Service (AWS) from Azure AD's Enterprise Application>
      url                  = https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/
      username             = <you>@example.com
      provider             = AzureAD
      mfa                  = Auto
      skip_verify          = false
      timeout              = 0
      aws_urn              = urn:amazon:webservices
      aws_session_duration = 28800
      aws_profile          = <new account name>
      resource_id          =
      subdomain            =
      role_arn             = arn:aws:iam::<new account id>:role/SSOAdministratorAccess
      region               = us-west-2
      ```

      You can now use **`saml2aws login -a <new account name>`** to log into the new account with your personal user credentials.
      From now on, you can use **`aws --profile <new account name> ...`**
      instead of the assumed role that was created earlier

7. Recover the root password for the new account

   1. Go to <https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home>

   2. Enter the email address you used to create the account above

   3. Click "Forgot password"

   4. An email will be sent to the email address to allow password reset

8. Store new root credentials in your password manager
